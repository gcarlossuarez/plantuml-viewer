# PlantUML Viewer

**PlantUML Viewer** is a desktop application designed to visualize diagrams generated by PlantUML scripts. It aims to enhance productivity and simplify workflow by providing an intuitive interface for viewing, exploring, and interacting with UML diagrams.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Easily visualize PlantUML diagrams directly from source files.
- **Real-time Rendering:** Instantly see diagram changes as you modify PlantUML source code.
- **Diagram Exploration:** Intuitive navigation and exploration of diagram components.
- **Export Capabilities:** Quickly export diagrams to common formats such as PNG, SVG, or PDF.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Designed to run seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## üéØ Benefits

- Enhances clarity and understanding of software architecture through visual diagrams.
- Improves productivity by providing immediate visual feedback while editing diagrams.
- Facilitates collaborative development through easy-to-share visual representations.
- Simplifies the documentation and maintenance of complex systems by visualizing interactions clearly.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To use it, position the cursor in a text file and right-click. The application will then search upward for a line containing the string `@startuml`; then downward for the file position where a line containing the string `@enduml` is located. The content between these two strings will be considered a PlantUML script and will be rendered in SVG or PNG format, as chosen. As you type, you can choose the display position without having to save the file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Currently supports diagrams generated strictly from PlantUML scripts; no support yet for other UML tools.
- Limited customization of visual themes and styles.
- Does not support interactive editing of diagrams (visualization is read-only).
